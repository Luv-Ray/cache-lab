# The gem5 Simulator

This is the repository for the gem5 simulator. It contains the full source code
for the simulator and all tests and regressions.

The gem5 simulator is a modular platform for computer-system architecture
research, encompassing system-level architecture as well as processor
microarchitecture. It is primarily used to evaluate new hardware designs,
system software changes, and compile-time and run-time system optimizations.

The main website can be found at <http://www.gem5.org>.

## Getting started

A good starting point is <http://www.gem5.org/about>, and for
more information about building the simulator and getting started
please see <http://www.gem5.org/documentation> and
<http://www.gem5.org/documentation/learning_gem5/introduction>.

## Building gem5

To build gem5, you will need the following software: g++ or clang,
Python (gem5 links in the Python interpreter), SCons, zlib, m4, and lastly
protobuf if you want trace capture and playback support. Please see
<http://www.gem5.org/documentation/general_docs/building> for more details
concerning the minimum versions of these tools.

Once you have all dependencies resolved, execute
`scons build/ALL/gem5.opt` to build an optimized version of the gem5 binary
(`gem5.opt`) containing all gem5 ISAs. If you only wish to compile gem5 to
include a single ISA, you can replace `ALL` with the name of the ISA. Valid
options include `ARM`, `NULL`, `MIPS`, `POWER`, `RISCV`, `SPARC`, and `X86`
The complete list of options can be found in the build_opts directory.

See https://www.gem5.org/documentation/general_docs/building for more
information on building gem5.

## Cache lab
NOTE: Lab codes are in `src/labs`.

Your task:
- implement Set associative cache.
- Fully associative cache use random replacement algorism for now, improve it.

Use `grade.sh` script to test your implementions.
